# Python code to describe metadata requirements for applied biocatalysis experiments

This is a test repository to collect code that tries to specify what metadata is required to describe fully experiments in Applied Biocatalysis. A working
group "STRENDA Biocatalysis" is developing standards for this. The requirements differ significantly for different types of experiment, and the group are
discussing decision trees, conditional lists etc to reflect this. One way to specify the requirements is through computer code, and the contents of this
repository are attempts to test how well this works.
